        <h1>Welcome to the story "life on mars"</h1>
        <p>After George discovered water and microscopic organisms, he completed his mission and goal board. The human transport rover returns to camp, and he sets course back to Earth. George is relieved to have completed his task successfully and is excited to share his findings with the rest of the world. As famous astronaut Neil Armstrong said,  "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." George has guessed he took more steps for man and a giant leap for humanity. As George makes his way back to camp, he reflects on his time on Mars and the incredible discoveries he made. He is grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a critical mission and is eager to see what the future holds for space exploration. Once George arrives at camp, he packs up all the equipment and supplies and ensures everything is secure for the journey home. Overall, George's discovery of microscopic lifeforms on Mars and his successful completion of his mission are significant steps forward in our understanding of the planet and its potential for supporting life. It is an exciting time for space exploration and the search for life beyond Earth.</p>
