        <p>George returns to mission command, the war room, to decide what’s next. Will he continue the missions alone or with a new team to help him... George has decided he needs a team to support and lead, especially with the more ambitious and challenging missions ahead. George could use teamwork and will make the tasks more complex and ambitious with hefty goals in mind. This makes the idea more manageable with a team to help him as a leader to lead this cosmic dream team. George works with NASA and other space agencies to assemble a team of highly skilled and experienced astronauts. He looks for individuals who have a deep understanding of space exploration and the technical skills and mental fortitude to handle the challenges of a possible return to Mars and beyond.  </p>
