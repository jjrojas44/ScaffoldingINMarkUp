        <h1>Welcome to the story "life on mars"</h1>
        <p>After George returns to mission command, he has a choice. He has achieved a great discovery as an astronaut, and he knows future missions will be even more ambitious, and the goals will only get more complex. He needs to go along and try to achieve his mission goals. Now, will he go at this alone, or will he make a team and form the potential dream team of astronauts for future missions? George decides to continue his missions as an astronaut alone. He knows that the challenges of exploring Mars require a high level of skill and expertise, and he is confident in his ability to handle the mission independently. So now what’s next for our hero, who has decided to go at this alone as the lone astronaut who knows… but he knows whatever his next adventure will be is guaranteed to be an amazing one and more discoveries to be made. </p>
