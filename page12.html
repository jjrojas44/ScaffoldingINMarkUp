        <p>George keeps exploring the Martian terrain. Suddenly, George sees something in the distance. It looks shiny and glimmers in the distance. Wait, it can’t be EUREKA. It’s a small stream of water flowing through a narrow rock channel. He can hardly believe his eyes. He stops the rover and looks closer at the stream of water. He’s amazed to see liquid water on the surface of Mars, and he knows that this discovery could have significant implications for the search for life on the planet, making the possibility for said outcome much more significant and more plausible. George knows this information will be invaluable to scientists and engineers working on future Mars missions. George has to think about his subsequent actions carefully. This is the discovery of the 21st century, and George needs to think about what to do next, whether to take a sample of water or to contact mission control to report the discovery, which George shall do first.</p>
