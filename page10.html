        <h1>Welcome to the story "life on mars"</h1>
        <p>George has started his mission and is excited to make human history in technology, science, and biology! You name it, aspects of history are being made in many fields. George checks his equipment and decides first to set out on the Martian terrain to find water and signs of life and to investigate the unusual readings. He drives for a while, scanning the horizon for any signs of moisture. The landscape is barren and rocky, but he keeps going. George moves for hours, checking the terrain for signs of dampness or life. He's excited to be on this mission and feels responsible for making the most of his time on Mars. He knows that every discovery he makes could significantly impact the future of space exploration. As he drives, he takes pictures and notes, documenting everything he sees signs of water. Still, he doesn't lose heart and keeps going, recording everything he sees, even a faraway shot of Olympus Mon, the giant volcano on the Martian surface, a little fun note George remembered in class: it is more than twice as tall as Mount Everest. It's the most giant volcano in the solar system. George continues his search for water or signs of life.  </p>
