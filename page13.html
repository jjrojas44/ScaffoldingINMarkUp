        <p>George has decided to collect samples of the water and check out the properties of the substance. George is thrilled to have discovered liquid water on the surface of Mars. He knows this discovery could have significant implications for the search for life on the planet, making the possibility for said outcome much more plausible. George decides to collect water samples and analyze their properties. He takes out his equipment and contains water samples from the stream. He then explores the models to determine their composition, temperature, and other properties. He records all his findings in detail, including the location of the stream and the time of day he made the discovery. George knows this information will be invaluable to scientists and engineers working on future Mars missions. George is excited to have made such an important discovery and is eager to see what other secrets Mars might hold; especially with this discovery, the chances of finding life on Mars have increased tenfold. George’s excitement keeps growing as he realizes he is a pioneer in space travel. George decides to inform mission control about the discovery. </p>
