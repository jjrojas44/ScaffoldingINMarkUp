        <h1>Welcome to the story "life on mars"</h1>
        <p>George had to make a critical decision on his mission to Mars. He had to decide whether to slingshot past or to the moon for resupply. After careful consideration, he chose to slingshot past the moon. His decision could be a very important one. The implication of going past the moon would be to save time and resources and reach Mars faster. Slingshots past the moon would be a significant milestone in human space exploration, demonstrating our ability to traverse the space and celestials' bodies and finally travel past the moon on a human-crewed spacecraft and not a robotic one. Slingshotting past the moon would require precise calculations and navigation to ensure a successful outcome. Any errors or miscalculations could result in a failed mission or even disaster. Slingshotting past the moon would also expose George to additional risks and challenges associated with long-duration spaceflight, such as radiation exposure, microgravity, and isolation. In the end, George's decision to slingshot past the moon was a bold and ambitious one. It would require significant resources and expertise, so with his will steeled, George decided to slingshot around the moon for another speed boost to reach Mars faster. Still, the risk of not resupplying critical supplies and materials was worth it. George would have to gamble and see.</p>
