        <p>George has made an incredible discovery of liquid water on the surface of Mars. He has to think about his subsequent actions carefully, as this is the discovery of the 21st century. The question is whether to take a water sample or contact mission control to report the findings. Based on the search results, it is recommended that George should contact mission control immediately about the water discovery before collecting samples. This is because discovering liquid water on Mars is a significant finding that could affect the search for life. It is essential to alert mission control as soon as possible so that they can begin to analyze the data and decide what actions are best for George to take next, which George assumes is to take samples of the water and explore the properties to take back to earth.  He can record all of his findings in detail, including the location of the stream and the time of day he made the discovery. Mission control has informed George of the following actions. He is to take further data to determine if there are signs of life near or in the pool of water. </p>
